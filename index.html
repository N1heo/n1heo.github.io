    <h2>Quick bio</h2>
    <p>So, I was born in 2003, in beatiful counrty called Kyrgyzstan, in the city Biskek, nature is cool here, but the infrastracture not so much. Studied in â„–70 school. For one year
        I lived in another country, close to Kyrgyzstan, it was Kazakhstan, the city was Astana. When I returned to my motherland, I felt much better. It was kinda gloomily
        in Astana. So, since then I lived here, in Biskek.

    <h3>Guitar</h3>
    <p>Sometimes I like to relax, playing some music. Not that good at it, but trying my best.. Mostly I use guitar as accompaniment for singing. My favourite songs to play are:
        "Take me to church", "In bloom", "Creep"..

    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>I never really was a sports guy, but in a few years it's changed a lot, now I cant imagine my life without physical activity. 
        <br/> I enjoy lots of sports, used to play table tennis in the school, then played some voleyball, but rightnow I am more into basketball. 
        <br/> Also recently I started going to the gym, feels nice. </p>
