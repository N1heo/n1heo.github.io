    <h3>Guitar</h3>
    <p>Sometimes I like to relax, playing some music. Not that good at it, but trying my best..</p>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>I never really was a sports guy, but in a few years it's changed a lot, now I cant imagine my life without physical activity. 
        <br/> I enjoy lots of sports, used to play table tennis in the school, then played some voleyball, but rightnow I am more into basketball. 
        <br/> Also recently I started going to the gym, feels nice. </p>
